# 🎬 GroupWatch - Movie Night Coordinator

Plan group movie nights without the chaos.

Movie Night Coordinator is a full‑stack web application designed to eliminate the friction of planning movie nights with friends, couples, or families. Instead of endless group chats and indecision, the app provides a structured, fair, and fun way to decide *what* to watch and *when* to watch it.

## The Problem

Planning a group movie night usually looks like this:

* Endless suggestions in group chats
* No clear voting or decision process
* Conflicting schedules
* Someone suggests a movie that isn’t available on everyone’s streaming service

The result? Decision fatigue, frustration, or the movie night never happens.

## The Solution

Movie Night Coordinator centralizes movie selection, scheduling, and discussion into one focused experience.

It helps groups:

* Decide **what to watch** using structured voting
* Agree on **when to watch** with scheduling tools
* Ensure movies are **actually available** to stream
* Discuss the movie **after watching**, all in one place
